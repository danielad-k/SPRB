<b> Overview of Capstone 2</b> </br>

This projet's purpose is to predict TripTypes for Walmart and understand which factors predict different Trip Types 

<b> Description </b> </br>

1.1 Walmart Preprocessing and Statistical Analysis: Feature Engineering and Statistical Analysis </br>
1.2 Walmart Basic Model - implements basic neural network with a single layer achieving 79% accuracy through feature engineering (undersampling, Robust Scaler). Using Shap Values, we looked at different feautures are import for trip types. </br>
1.3 Walmart Modeling LSTM - uses LSTM model to predict TripTypes. Unfortunately, this model had poor accuracy and was discarted. </br>
1.4 Walmart TripType Presentation - presentation about project.
